# Project11
## The objective here is to create a bouncer game using SpriteKit.

### The player throw balls and the objective is to make them bounce, if the ball hit the spaces between the obstacles the player looses 1 point

## Challenge

### The pictures we’re using in have other ball pictures rather than just “ballRed”. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
### Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.
### Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.
